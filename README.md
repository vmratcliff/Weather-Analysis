# Python API Challenge

### "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

## Part I - WeatherPy

Creatw a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 
Utilizing a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

First objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Next objective is to run linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Final notebook includes:

* Randomly selected **at least** 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
* Performed a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
* Included a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
* Saved a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.

### Part II - VacationPy

Used jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API for this part of the assignment.

* Created a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from the part I of the challenge.
* Narrowed down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. 
* Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.
* Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the **Hotel Name**, **City**, and **Country**.
